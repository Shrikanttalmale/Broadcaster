## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get started:

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly: `npm run test`
5. Format code: `npm run format`
6. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "Add feature: description"`
7. Push to branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Create Pull Request

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: All code must be strongly typed
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier (auto-format on commit)
- **Linting**: Follow ESLint rules
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic
- **Tests**: Aim for 80%+ coverage
