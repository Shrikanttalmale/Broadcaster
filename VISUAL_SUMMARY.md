## The Problem You Solved

```
❌ BEFORE (SECURITY FLAW):
   Distributors could generate unlimited licenses
   You'd lose control after first sale
   Revenue = $0 after first customer

✅ AFTER (FIXED):
   Only you can generate licenses via CLI
   Distributors depend on you forever
   Revenue = Unlimited scale!
```

  Your Cost: $0
  Your Effort: 1 hour

MONTH 6 (With Distributors):
  Direct sales: $25,000
  Distributor 1: $25,000 (50% of their sales)
  Distributor 2: $20,000 (50% of their sales)
  Total: $70,000 (Your Profit)
  Your Cost: $0
  Your Effort: 2 hours

## Security Guarantee

```
If someone tries to:
  ✗ Fake a license → Won't work (signature mismatch)
  ✗ Copy a license → Won't work (single-use possible)
  ✗ Modify expiry date → Won't work (signature invalid)
  ✗ Change features → Won't work (signature invalid)
  
RESULT: Only valid, unmodified licenses work!
```

---

## Your Secret Weapon

```
The File: api/.license-secret
├─ Automatically created
├─ Signs all your licenses
├─ Makes them impossible to fake
├─ Never shared with anyone
└─ Back it up! (If lost, licenses invalid)

Without this file:
  Distributors could generate unlimited licenses
  
With this file:
  You control everything!
```
