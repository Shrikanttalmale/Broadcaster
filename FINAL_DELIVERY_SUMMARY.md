## 🚀 How It Works (Quick Overview)

### Installation
```bash
cd api && npm install
```

### Generate Licenses
```bash
npm run generate-license --type user --count 50 --customer "ABC Corp" --format csv --save
```

### Output
- ✓ 50 licenses generated (5 seconds)
- ✓ Saved to database (permanent record)
- ✓ Exported to CSV (send to customer)

### Send to Customer
- Email the CSV file
- Customer extracts license keys
- Customer enters one license in app
- App validates signature
- ✓ App works!

### Get Paid
- Customer pays $5,000
- Your profit: $5,000
- Your cost: $0
- Your effort: 10 minutes total

---

## 💰 Revenue Model

### Phase 1: Direct Sales (Now)
```
Month 1:
  Customer A: 50 licenses × $100 = $5,000
  Customer B: 30 licenses × $100 = $3,000
  Total: $8,000
  Cost: $0
  Effort: 1 hour
```

### Phase 2: Distributor Model (Future)
```
Month 6:
  Direct sales: $25,000
  Distributor 1: $25,000 (50% commission)
  Distributor 2: $20,000 (50% commission)
  Total: $70,000
  Cost: $0
  Effort: 2 hours
```

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Signature System
```
When you generate a license:
  1. Create license data
  2. Sign with YOUR secret key
  3. Store signature with license

When customer uses license:
  1. App receives license data + signature
  2. App recalculates signature
  3. Compare: Should match
  4. If match: ✓ Valid license
  5. If no match: ✗ Invalid license (rejected)

Result: Impossible to fake or modify!
```

### What Distributors Can't Do
```
❌ Can't see your secret key
❌ Can't generate new licenses
❌ Can't modify existing licenses
❌ Can't fake signatures
❌ Can't extend expiry dates
❌ Can't add features
```

### Why You're Secure
```
✓ Only you have CLI access
✓ Only you have secret key
✓ Only you can generate licenses
✓ Distributors completely dependent
✓ You maintain complete control
```
